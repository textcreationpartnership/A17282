         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And then he ſhall confirme this his diſcourſe with ſome reaſon, or authority, to the end he may apply the ſame more ſoundly to his owne profit.

                  <p>As for example, (not to part from the miſtery already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the incarnation) if in the preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did only read the hiſtory of the Annunciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, related by S. Luke, in the firſt chapter, where he ſaith: <hi>The Angell Gabriell was ſent from God to a citty of Galilee, which was called Nazareth, to a Virgin eſpouſed vnto a man whoſe name was Ioſeph of the houſe of Dauid, and the name of the Virgin was Mary.</hi> Here without framing the whole diſcourſe of the hiſtory, as yt may piouſly be thought to haue happened, and without conſidering to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly what action God might performe, or what word he did

                  </p>
                  <p>Then let the vnderſtanding being aſſiſted by the memory, take one or more conditions of thoſe which belong to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God, who ſent the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell and let yt ſay in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>God hath a most judicious and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent knowledg in his determinations,</hi> and from hence he ſhall take occaſion to diſcourſe and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in this manner. <hi>Therefore God did not rashly ſend the Angell to the bleſſed Virgin, but with great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſideration, for ſo we ſee prudent and wiſe men vſe to vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5072:31"/> and performe theyr actions.

Therefore ſome motiue must needs be repreſented vnto God, whereby he must be moued to ſend the Angell. But what motiue can euer be found for ſuch an action? The motiues by which men are commonly induced to ſuch actions, are taken either from theyr own perſon, or from the perſon of them to whom they ſend the embaſſage, therefore the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue which induced God to ſend the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, muſt eyther be taken from himſelf. or from thoſe perſons to whom the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell was ſent.</hi>

                  <p>Here the memory ſhall add ſome condition concerning the perſon of men, ſaying. <hi>Men had

                  <p>And this diſcourſe he may confirme with ſome reaſon, or authority (as I ſaid before yt was needfull to doe) as in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>And truly yt ſeemeth he could doe no other, ſuppoſing he did loue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſo harty affection: for the nature of loue ys ſuch, that yt cannot endure to ſee the party loued in perill, or mistery. And therefore ſo yt befell the father of the prodigull child, who for that he loued his ſoune with great, and paſsionate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, albeyt the ſonne had behaued himſelf very ill towards his father, had for ſaken him, and ſpent his goods, had dishonoured his houſe, &amp; in few words had giuen him very ill ſatiſfaction: yet

God</hi> (ſhall the memory ſay) <hi>ys by nature ſo mercifull, that as the prophet ſaith, his mercyes are aboue all his works; and of him yt ys truly ſaid,</hi> cui propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſt miſereri ſemper, &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, <hi>to whom yt ys most proper euer to take pitty, &amp; to pardon, and further he hath a will most ready, &amp; effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined to perform the workes of mercy, and loue. Therefore</hi> (ſhall the vnderſtanding ſay) <hi>moued by his diuine nature and the loue he beareth to mankind, he was ſodainly inclined
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5072:35"/> to compaſsion, and tooke the reſolution of redeeming them, from the miſeryes and perills they were in, and with his most prompt, and effectuall wil reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to doe yt with out delay, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gann to think in what manner yt might best be effected. And becauſe the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of his diuine majeſty ys most cleare, and ſwift, and ſeeing all in an instant, that can be in the matter, he preſently found out the meanes of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuating this charitable reſolution of his will, and did ſoone perceiue, that no pure creature could poſsibly remedy ſo great an euill, and that yt was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary that his diuine power should therein ſupply the impotency of creatures. He did therefore ſee, that yt was conuenient to proceede in this cauſe, not only as his most mercifull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture required, but alſo as his naturall justice did exact: wherefore he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that although his mercy might

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hauing ſeene oll this his inclination to doe good vnto men, &amp; the loue which he bare them, did effectually moue him, to the reſolution of taking vppon him our humane nature.</hi> Here ſhall the

                  <p>And ſo here ys found out in reſpect of the perſons, beſides the foreſaid conſideration of God, the perſons alſo of men, &amp; God himſelf ys found diſtinct in three perſons. As for words we haue found out part of that, which the father or the ſone, or the holy ghoſt might ſpeak, and we haue in ſinuated that which might be ſaid alſo by men: As for workes we haue found out, beſides that of gods behoulding the earth, that he alſo, being moued with compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the miſeryes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd, reſolued to help them:

But becauſe in likelyhood the hiſtory would ſeeme to contayne more then this, the memory ſhall paſſe further, &amp; ſhall propound other conditions of God, and ſhall ſay. <hi>The diuine nature ys ſo perfect, &amp; yt ys naturally ſo proper vnto yt, to be most farr from all imperfection, and defect, eſpecially of that kind which hath any reſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or shadow of ſinne, that yt will not by any meanes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the least iott thereof, eyther in yt ſelf, or in any thing that belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to yt: but rather (to ſpeake after our manner) ſuppoſing he could ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ouerruled by paſsion of hate or colher, he should be ſo ouerruled with them towards ſynne and ſynfull defects, that he would wholy deſtroy

                  </p>
                  <p>Here ſhall the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reply. <hi>Therefore that he might not contract any like stayne, in making himſelf man; for that he well knew the castiſement which he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aid vppon Adam for the ſynne that he had committed (to wit, that all should be borne in originall ſynne, proceeding from him by way of generation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and woman) he did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolue, not to begotten or brought forth in this manner. And as he ys wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome yt ſelf, he did preſently ſee, that the fittest manner would be, to be borne of a woman without ceparation of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nor did his moſt perfect nature content yt ſelf with this, but would vnite vnto himſelf a body which should be in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects most perfect. And becauſe a tinge ys then more perfect, when yt ys framed of more perfect matter, and when yt hath alſo other accidentall diſpoſitions
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:5072:38"/> more perfect in theſelues, he did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolue, that the woman of whom he would be borne should be amost pure Virgin, to the end that framing his body and flesh of her purest bloud, the ſame should alſo be most pure, and without all imperfection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here ſhal the memory ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt. <hi>God doth not only permit himſelf (according to our manner of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) to be ouercome with the paſsion of Loue, in bearing affection to mankind, but likewiſe in his affection to vertue, and in particular to humility: Yea, I doe remember, I haue read in S.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hereof the vnderſtanding ſhall inferr. <hi>Therefore he would not take flesh of any one that had beene only a virgin, vnleſſe shee had beene alſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5072:38"/> humble. And therefore with his diuine vnderſtanding, vnto which all things are preſent, and manifeſt, he did clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely ſee, that Mary the ſpouſe of Ioſeph in Nazareth had both theſe vertues ioyned together in great perfection, &amp; ſo determined to make her his mother,</hi> Here finally the memory ſhall adioyne. <hi>God hath imperiall digniti, and abſolute dominion ouer all creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Then the vnderſtanding ſhall ſay. <hi>Here vppon, as ſupreame King and Lord of the Angels, to vvhom yt belongeth to ſerue himſelf of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he called vnto him Gabriell the archanhell, and deliuered, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his diuine vvill, and pleaſure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting vnto him the embaſſage, vvhich in his name should be deliuered to the Virgin, vvherefore the Euangelist ſaith very vvell.
